"""
Permanently simplify heavy geometries in the database.

Problem: Some polygons have 500,000-800,000 vertices (imported from very
detailed 2023 shapefiles). This makes EVERY query slow because PostGIS
must simplify these massive geometries on every request.

Solution: Run ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology ONCE and UPDATE the geometry
permanently. This is safe because the map display doesn't need sub-meter
precision. The original shapefile remains as the reference.

Threshold: Only simplify polygons with more than 10,000 vertices.
Tolerance: 0.0003 degrees (~33m) — preserves all visible detail on a map.

Usage:
    python manage.py simplify_geometries              # Preview (dry run)
    python manage.py simplify_geometries --apply       # Apply permanently
    python manage.py simplify_geometries --apply --tolerance 0.0005  # More aggressive
